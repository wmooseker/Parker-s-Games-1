This is an example of using AJAX with JQuery to get data from a REST API and display, interact, and store data. 

Admittedly, this site as a whole is rudimentary, as I am only linking to separate HTML Pages, Normally I would use node or a frontend framework to accomplish this. However when I created this site I set out with the intention of practicing and showing the use of JQuery and Bootstrap.

Using data from the RAWG games API, on this site you can do a multitude of games. Since it is designed loosely like an E-commerce site, there is a home page with some prominent games, as well as a browse by categories page, a search by tags page, and a top search bar that will give a dropdown list of games that are close to an input string.
